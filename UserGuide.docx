How to Play Sudoku:
The objective is to be able to place the numbers 1 through 9 in positions where that there is only one of each number in every box, column and row. No number should be repeated in any box, column or row. It is also important to note that every puzzle has one unique solution which can only be found by applying logic to the puzzle.

Scoring System
Every game has an initial score of 3000 plus the rating of the level of the game. The scoring formula is 
Score = Rating + Time Bonus - Accuracy – Solve Aids
Rating - the rating index assigned to each puzzle (Easy-10, Medium-20, Hard-30 and Evil-40)
Time Bonus – Score is reduced proportionally as the time increases. Score is reduced by 1 point for every second.
Accuracy - the number of errors you make. For every error, 30 points will be deducted.
Solve Aids - Each time you use a hint, score is reduced based on the difficulty level (Easy-10, Medium-20, Hard-30 and Evil-50)
